/*
brute force - push all nodes while traversing in hashmap/set and check if node was pushed previously or not

Floydâ€™s Cycle-Finding Algorithm // fast slow approach // 2 pointers // "tortoise and the hare algorithm"

Approach: This is the fastest method and has been described below:
Traverse linked list using two pointers.
Move one pointer(slow) by one and another pointer(fast) by two.
If these pointers meet at the same node then there is a loop. 
If pointers do not meet then linked list doesnâ€™t have a loop.

		// we will increment fast by 2 step and slow by 1 step
        while (fast != nullptr && fast -> next != nullptr){
            
            slow = slow -> next;
            fast = fast -> next -> next;
            
            // At the point if fast and slow are at same address
			// this means linked list has a cycle in it.
            if (slow == fast)
