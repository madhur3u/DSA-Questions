// https://leetcode.com/problems/set-matrix-zeroes/

// Instead of taking two dummy arrays we can use the first row and column of the matrix for the same work. 
// This will help to reduce the space complexity of the problem. While traversing for the second time the 
// first row and column will be computed first, which will affect the values of further elements thatâ€™s why 
// we traversing in the reverse direction.

// Space - O(1) as we made only two bool variables which is constant space

//          O(m) for setting 1st row
//          O(n) for setting 1st col
// Total -> O(2*n*m) --> O(n*m)
